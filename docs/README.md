# User Guide

## What is Duke?
Duke is a personal task manager which records your tasks, remembers the status 
of your tasks, and shows you all your tasks at one go. Duke uses a command-line 
interface, where single-line user commands are used for interaction. Duke also 
stores your tasks locally, so that your data persists between sessions.

## Features 
* [Add Task: Todo](#todo) - Add a `todo` to the task list
* [Add Task: Deadline](#deadline) - Add a `deadline` to the task list
* [Add Task: Event](#event) - Add an `event` to the task list
* [Delete Task](#delete) - Delete a task from the task list
* [Mark Task as Complete](#done) - Set the status of a task to `done`
* [View Task List](#list) - Show all tasks added to Duke's task list
* [Find a Task](#find) - Search for a task by name
* [Exit](#bye) - Exit Duke
