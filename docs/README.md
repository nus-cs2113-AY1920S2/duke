## Introduction

Hiroshi Nagai Task Tracker(HNTT) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their tasks*.
It is worth noting that HNTT is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI).
It helps you save todos, events and deadlines.

## Quick Start

*  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
*  Download the latest `hiroshi.jar` [latest reslease here!](https://github.com/alaukiknpant/duke/releases/tag/v0.2).
*  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Task tracker.
*  Go to the directory where the Jar file is stored and type: `java -jar Hiroshi.jar`
* When the application executes, all possible commands that can help you manage your tasks are shown.
*Some example commands you can try:
    * **`list`** : lists all tasks that have been added and saved. until now
    * **`todo`**`finish all your Computer Science homework` : adds a todo task with the corresponding description to the Task List.
    * **`delete`**`1` : deletes the 1st item in your current task list
    * **`bye`** : exits the app


## Features
