## Introduction

*Nini* is a Task Manager built upon Duke's starter 
code that assists Users with their lists of tasks.

Events or Deadlines. For more details of how *Nini*
manages the list of Tasks, refer to the *Features* section below.

## Quick Start

## FAQ 

1. __The software says I have a missing duke file and it could not create one for me__ <br/>
	Please create a text file called 'duke.txt' file inside a folder called 'data'.
	Ensure that the data folder is under the same directory as the Jar file. <br/>
	Example: <br/>

1. __I am unable to add Tasks that contains "~" as a Task description__
	Tilde or also known as "~" is used as a delimiter when storing data. Therefore, using 
	tilde as part of the Task description will lead to inaccurate storage of data. 
	Please find an alternative for the usage of tilde.
