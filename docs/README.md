# Introduction
This Duke program is a Chat Box program named **LumiChat** that manages a list of user-created tasks.
  
You will be interacting with the application via the command line with a virtual character called **Lumi**. Through the **LumiChat** program, you will be able to perform various operations to manage your tasks like adding, deleting and viewing tasks in a Task List.
  
There are 3 different types of tasks in the **LumiChat** program.

#### <u>Types of tasks</u>

| Task Type    | Description                                                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **To Do**    | A task that the you want to do with <u>no</u> *date time* restrictions. |
| **Deadline** | A task that you want to do <u>by</u> a certain *date time*              |
| **Event**    | A task that you want to do <u>at</u> a certain *date time*              |

This should cover most of the common task types in a normal daily life.
  
I hope that you will enjoy the use of the **LumiChat** program. **Have fun!!**

<br><br>

# Miscellaneous Information

## Help
In the event that you ever forget the usage of a command, you can look it up within the **LumiChat** program itself. All you need to do is to enter the *keyword* `help`, followed by the command you wish to query.   
  
Below is the **exhaustive** list of words recognised by the program for you to query:  
 `add`,  `todo`, `deadline`, `event`, `done`, `list`, `delete`, `find`, `due`, `bye` or `exit`, `datetime`, `date`, `time`, `timespecifier` or `timespec`

<br>

## Exiting the LumiChat Program
Exiting the **LumiChat** program is simple. Simply enter `bye` to exit.
Upon exiting, the program will [save](#saving) your Task List into a file in your device.

<br>

## Loading and Saving
The **LumiChat** program loads and saves your Task List **automatically**, so there is no explicit way to freely load or save your file.  
### Loading 
Loading is done once you start up the **LumiChat** program. The data from the *task list file* in your device is read to initialise your Task List from when you last saved.  
   
If the *task list file* is corrupted, an option will be given to **continue** the program with a new **empty** Task List, or to **abort** the program.

### Saving
Saving is only done upon [exiting](#exiting-the-lumichat-program) the **LumiChat** program. The current tasks in your Task List will be saved into a *task list file* in your device.  
  
Should there be an *unfortunate* error in saving your Task List, an option will be given to **continue** to exit the program **without** saving your Task List, or to **stay** in the program *(when you may then try to manually salvage the tasks in your Task List)*.

<br>

## Date Time Formats
Any *date time* data that you provide has to adhere to certain formats pre-defined by the **LumiChat** program. Failure to do so will likely result in the program to be unable to recognise your input command, and a warning will be shown.  
Instances when you may need to enter a *date time* will be when [adding a **Deadline**](#b-deadline--add-a-deadline-task-to-your-task-list) or an [**Event**](#c-event--add-an-event-task-to-your-task-list) task, or [filtering the Task List by a *time period*](#b-due--filter-tasks-from-your-task-list-by-a-specified-time-period).
  
Here are the following *date time* formats.
  
### Date Formats
There are **two** types *date* formats allowed.

#### 1. Words
You may enter **only** the following *date* words.
- `today` or `tdy` -- represents the <u>current</u> date
- `tomorrow` or `tmr` -- represents the <u>next</u> date
- `yesterday` or `yst` -- represents the <u>previous</u> date

> **Note**: All dates are taken with reference to the current date on your device.
  
#### 2. Standard Date Format
This refers to the typical dates that are represented with **numbers** and **delimiter symbols**.  
  
In this **LumiChat**  program, *dates* should be in the order of **day**, **month**, then an <u>optional</u> **year**. If the **year** is not provided, the program will automatically assume it to be the **current year**.  Also, the **day**, **month** and **year** should only be entered as **numbers** and not words *(e.g. January is not accepted for the **month** attribute)*.
  
Regarding **delimiters**, the program will **only** consider `/` and `-` as valid delimiters for *dates*.  Delimiters are <u>optional</u> and may be omitted provided you include the **year** of the *date* *(e.g. 1/1/20, 1/1 and 010120 are accepted, but not 0101).*

An **exhaustive** list of the standard *date* formats is given below for your reference.
```
	dd/MM/yyyy, d/MM/yyyy, dd/M/yyyy, d/M/yyyy, 
	dd/MM/yy, d/MM/yy, dd/M/yy, d/M/yy,
	dd/MM, d/MM, dd/M, d/M,
	dd-MM-yyyy, d-MM-yyyy, dd-M-yyyy, d-M-yyyy, 
	dd-MM-yy, d-MM-yy, dd-M-yy, d-M-yy,
	dd-MM, d-MM, dd-M, d-M,
	ddMMyyyy, ddMMyy
```

### Time Formats
The **LumiChat** program accepts most time formats that are represented with **numbers**, **delimiter symbols** and <u>optional</u> **am-pm markers**.  
  
The *time* should be in the order of  **hour**, then **minute**. The **seconds** attribute of *time* should **not** be given. The **minute** attribute must be a **double** digit *(i.e. single digits must be padded with a 0 in front)*. The **minute** attribute is also <u>optional</u>, and should it be omitted, the **LumiChat** program will automatically set the **minute** to be 0. Both the **12-h** format and the **24-h** format are valid *time* formats for this program.  
  
Regarding **delimiters**, the program will **only** consider `:` and `.` as valid delimiters for *time*.  Delimiters are <u>optional</u> and may be omitted.

Lastly, the **am-pm marker** is an <u>optional</u> attribute, and should it be omitted, the **LumiChat** program will automatically assume the *time* to follow the **24-h** format.

An **exhaustive** list of the *time* formats is given below for your reference.
```
	h:mma, H:mma, H:mm,
	h.mma, H.mma, H.mm,
	hmma, Hmma, Hmm,
	ha, Ha, H
```

### Time Specifier Formats
The *time specifier* is used in conjunction with a *date* to define the *time period* to [filter tasks in the Task List](#b-due--filter-tasks-from-your-task-list-by-a-specified-time-period). The following words are considered valid *time specifiers* in the **LumiChat** program.
- `on` -- <u>on</u> the specified *date*
- `after` or `a` -- <u>after</u> the specified *date*
- `before` or `b` -- <u>before</u> the specified *date*

The *time specifier* is <u>optional</u> and if omitted, is set to `on`.
