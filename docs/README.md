# Features

**Save/load**: Any previous tasks added to this app earlier will be loaded to the app during startup. Conversely, all tasks in the app will be saved when the app is closed.

## Understanding the syntax
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
> 
>   E.g. in `event NAME /at TIME`, `NAME` and `TIME` are parameters which can be replaced to be `event meeting /at 5pm`.
> 
> - `/IDENTIFIER` such as `/by` and `/at` must be supplied to recognise the parameters after them.
