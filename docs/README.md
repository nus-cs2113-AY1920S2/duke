##1. Introduction
    ____________________________________________________________
	Hello! I'm Duke
	It seems like you are needing some help.
	____________________________________________________________
	
Duke is a chatbot that actually resemble what is so-called ToDoList applications that we usually use nowadays.
However, this application has not yet had a GUI (Graphics User Interface) like the one we usually see but it is
functioning with CLI (Command Line Interface). Since there is no GUI, it will be a bit tough for some customer
to get used to this application. Therefore, we will be having a brief explanation of how to get started to this 
chatbot

To run the chatbot, type this command to the terminal/command prompt
    
    java -jar duke-0.2.jar

Remember to set path for Java beforehand or you can simply set a permanent path for java by typing

    set path={some_path_in_your_folder}\Java\jdk-11.0.1\bin

new directory and save them after terminating the program
